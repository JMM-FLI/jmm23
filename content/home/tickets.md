Our event is free of charge, however due to space constraints, admission will be limited to registered participants only. Please note that registration will be open until **April 15**, but early closure may occur if we reach the room capacity earlier. To register, please download the registration form ([docx](files/registration_docx.docx), [pdf](files/registration_pdf.pdf)), fill it out, and send it to jmm@leibniz-fli.de. Registered participants will receive an abstract submission form for poster presentations in due course.
