In the first edition of 'Jena Microbiome Meeting', we aim to create an opportunity for microbiome researchers to connect, collaborate, and develop new interdisciplinary projects, ideas, and approaches that can substantially advance the field.

As the field of microbiome research continues to evolve, there is a growing and urgent need to bring together researchers with expertise in different areas to foster interdisciplinary collaborations. Therefore, we are organizing the Jena Microbiome Meeting to provide an exchange platform for researchers from diverse backgrounds and career stages who are interested in microbiome research.

We invite you to explore our website to learn more about the event. Whether you are a seasoned microbiome researcher or a student just beginning to explore this exciting field, we hope that you will find the Jena Microbiome Meeting to be an invaluable resource for advancing your research and expanding your professional network.
